## About

ðŸ¤– Nothing to see here.

I'm just playing around with [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI).

Also using this to experiment with packaging C++ software with Nix.

Still here?  Lower your expectations.

If you don't have Nix, then
* `sudo apt install make ftxui cmake gcc` or similar
* `make` to build it.
* `./build/ftxui-game` to run it.

If you have Nix, then
* `nix build` to build it.
* `nix run` to run it.
